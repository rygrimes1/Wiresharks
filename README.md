# Wiresharks: Reproducibility Project for HACKHPC@ADMI25

This document outlines the Wiresharks team's project for the HACKHPC@ADMI25 Hackathon, detailing our goals, team structure, and our process for evaluating reproducible science.

## Project Overview

Our core objective for the ADMI25 Hackathon is to delve into the critical area of **reproducible science** within computing research. As Team Wiresharks, we are undertaking the hands-on task of reproducing an existing scientific project that is hosted on GitHub. Our primary aim is to thoroughly assess how straightforward or challenging it is for others to replicate previously published research.

Through this practical reproduction attempt, we seek to answer several key questions regarding research reproducibility:

* **Did the repo include all necessary code?**

* **Was the dataset public and accessible?**

* **Were instructions up to date?**

* **Any issues with dependencies or hardware?**

* **How close were your results to theirs?**

By meticulously documenting every step taken, challenges encountered, and solutions implemented, we will assign a comprehensive reproducibility rating to the project. This will provide valuable insights into the practical realities of replicating scientific studies.

## Team Wiresharks

Our team consists of four members from Hampton University, each with defined roles to ensure a successful hackathon experience:

* **Auiana D'Avilar** - Portal Builder & Slide Guru

  * *Responsibilities:* Builds the webpage or GitHub Pages site to host our findings and progress. Prepares final presentation slides and visuals to explain our journey.

* **Ayinde Hooks** - Scribe

  * *Responsibilities:* Takes notes during meetings, tracks what worked and what didn't, and documents all steps and errors. Reads the paper and understands the project scope. Skims the GitHub repository to note included code/data. Documents every step, issue, or fix.

* **Howard "Shiloh" Ames** - Coder

  * *Responsibilities:* Reproduces the original code, sets up the environment, and runs the model/tools. Attempts to install dependencies and run sample parts of the code. Runs the main experiments/analysis from the paper. Compares any results with what the paper shows. Records any differences or blockers.

* **Ryan Grimes** - Portal Builder & Slide Guru

  * *Responsibilities:* Builds the webpage or GitHub Pages site to host our findings and progress. Prepares final presentation slides and visuals to explain our journey. Sets up GitHub Pages or a well-organized README. Tests the portal to ensure everything works and that the repository is clean and accessible. Helps with practicing the presentation and telling the story clearly.

## Our Process (Hackathon Schedule)

Our hackathon plan is structured across several days, focusing on systematic evaluation and clear deliverables:

### Day 1: Kickoff & Understanding

* **Assign Roles:** Clearly define individual team responsibilities.

* **Read the Paper:** Thoroughly understand the project's scope.

* **Skim the GitHub Repo:** Identify available code and data.

### Day 2: Environment Setup

* **Install Dependencies:** Attempt to install all required software.

* **Run Sample Code:** Test small code sections for basic functionality.

* **Note Challenges:** Document any issues (e.g., outdated libraries, missing data).

### Day 3: Reproduction Attempt

* **Run Main Experiments:** Execute core analyses from the paper.

* **Compare Results:** Check if our findings align with the original paper.

* **Record Differences/Blockers:** Document any discrepancies or unresolved issues.

* **Scribe Documentation:** Maintain a detailed log of all steps.

### Day 4: Build & Deliverables

* **Rate Reproducibility (1-5):**

  * **1 = Impossible:** Cannot be run due to critical issues or missing parts.

  * **3 = Doable with moderate effort:** Requires troubleshooting or minor fixes.

  * **5 = Plug and play:** Runs perfectly by simply following the instructions.

* **Build Portal:** Set up GitHub Pages or create a clean README.

* **Test Portal:** Ensure all content is accessible and functional.

* **Polish Slides:** Refine the presentation for clarity.

* **Practice Presentation:** Prepare for a clear and concise delivery.

Thank you for visiting our repository! We hope our work contributes to a better understanding of reproducible research practices.
